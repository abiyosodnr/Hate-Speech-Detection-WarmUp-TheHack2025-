# üõ°Ô∏è Hate Speech Detection - Warmup Project for The Hack 2025

This repository contains a machine learning project developed as a warmup before participating in **The Hack 2025**, an innovation program organized by **UKM CCI - Telkom University**. Our team is building a text classification system to detect **hate speech** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

The project emphasizes end-to-end implementation ‚Äî from text preprocessing to model evaluation ‚Äî and is intended to strengthen our technical readiness ahead of the competition.

## üß† Methodology

### 1. Dataset

We use a labeled dataset containing text samples categorized into:
- Hate Speech (1) 
- Non Hate Speech (0)

### 2. Preprocessing

Text cleaning and preparation include:
- Lowercasing  
- Removing special characters and numbers  
- Stopword removal  
- Tokenization & Lemmatization  
- Normalization (slang conversion if necessary)  

### 3. Feature Extraction

We convert text into numerical representations using:
- TF-IDF Vectorization  
- (Optional) Bag-of-Words  

### 4. Model Training

Machine learning & Deep learning models are tested:
- Naive Bayes  
- Sequential (BiLSTM)

### 5. Evaluation

We evaluate models using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall
